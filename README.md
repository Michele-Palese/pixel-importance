# Identifying discriminative pixels in hand-drawn spiral images to detect Parkinson‚Äôs disease.

# Overview
This project performs an image-based analysis using R to identify which pixels are most relevant for distinguishing spirals drawn by Parkinson‚Äôs disease patients from those drawn by healthy individuals.

- Dataset: ~50 subjects

- Image size: 64√ó64 grayscale

- Goal: Highlight pixels most informative for classification

Unlike deep learning approaches, I focus on interpretable models.

## Methods
Two supervised learning models were applied:

- LASSO-regularized logistic regression ‚Äì for sparse, interpretable feature selection

- Random Forest ‚Äì to evaluate non-linear pixel importance

Achieved strong classification performance, even with limited data

üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
R ‚â• 4.0

Packages: glmnet, randomForest, dplyr, ranger
